Inspired by Rick and Morty's crazy, goofy and diverse aesthetic, and "Doors of Doom" game mechanics, I'm making a simple turn-based roguelike game. 

-----------

Player:
- Gear:
  - Main armor (body)
  - Secondary armor (helmet)
  - Weapon (arm)
- Attack range
- Health
- Experience
- Level (at every level you get an upgrade and bonus money)
- Portal/Elevator gun fluid (number of available battles)
- Inventory

Enemies:
- Health
- Attack range
- Drop awards

Items (all items have their descirption):
Consumable items:
- Foods/Fruits:
  - Smallest amount
  - Medium amount
  - Large amount
- Healing items/potions:
  - Small 
  - Medium
  - Large
- Increase max health
- Increase max damage (temporarly)
- Deal highest end of damage (temporarly)
- Increase armor (temporarly)
- Increase dodge chance (temporarly)

Wearable items:
- Variety of different main, secondary armors as well as weapons
- Main idea is that main armors are larger numbers, secondary are lesser, weapons have variety of different attack ranges, maybe include like a bonus element damage

Shop:
- Ability to purchase armor, weapons, gun fluid, consumables

Enemy types:
- Simple creeps
- Elite monsters (can be same as simple, just enhanced)
- Bosses (every 20-50 levels)
